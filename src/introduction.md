# Introduction

OpenBook is the central limit orderbook at the heart of Solana DeFi.
Founded during one of the darkest moments in Solana history, OpenBook embodies
both the resilience of the community and an aspirational vision of Solana
DeFiâ€™s future - open-source, permissionless, community-driven, and infinitely
composable.
